# `psntools`

## Overview

`psntools` is a Python package to perform Protein Structure Network (PSN) analysis on any protein system, provided a PDB file describing the topology of the protein system and a matrix representing the Protein Structure Network in form of adjacency matrix.

## Requirements

This package requires `python` 3.7 or higher to be installed.

## Installation

This package can be installed by downaloading the package, unzipping it, going into the package directory and running `python setup.py install`.

All required Python dependencies will be automatically installed if not already present.

## Usage

The package contains several modules to perform various tasks related to PSN analysis and subsequent data processing and visualization. Please refer to the user guide for a detailed description of the modules and their functions.

## Work in progress

The unit tests for `psntools` are currently being written.

# Output file settings (passed to matplotlib.pyplot.savefig)
output:
  # DPI (the higher the number, the higher the resolution)
  dpi: 300
  # Whether to have a transparent or opaque background
  transparent: True
  # Bbox in inches. If 'tight', use tight layout for the figure

    # How to sort the sets intersections:
    # - 'degree' means sorting by the intersections' degrees (i.e.
    #   how many sets are intersecting);
    # - 'cardinality' means sorting by the number of elements in each
    #   intersection.

    # Whether to sort in ascending order
    ascending: True
